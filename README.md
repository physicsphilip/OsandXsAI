**Noughts and Crosses**

Simple command-line version of noughts and crosses written in Python.

Player v player, player vs AI and AI vs AI are all possible. For AI vs AI, it is possible to run many games and plot basic summary statistics.

There are three different AIs available: one that picks a place at random; another that picks spaces in a sequential order; and another that has been trained using TensorFlow.

This work is strongly inspired by Dan Lester's TensorFlow Nought and Crosses project, which is probably better overall:
